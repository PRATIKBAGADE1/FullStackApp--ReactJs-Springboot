# FullStackApp--ReactJs-Springboot
Create Full stack web application using **Spring Boot and React**. I used Spring Boot ( MVC, JPA, Hibernate) and Mysql Database to create the Backend application (Restful web service API) with and use React.js to create the frontend application with **Material UI and React Hooks( useState, useEffect)** with functional components. I build simple full stack project with **RESTful Web services API** and also use fetch (you can use axios) for consuming REST API.
